# FunMap2.0
---- Not Published Version ----

## You can use FunMap2.0 with your own library of functions. Here is how:
1. Make a copy of functions.py that is located in ./Interpreter/ and rename it (we consider it as new_function_script.py)
2. Edit new_function_script.py by adding your functions definitions following the sctructure provided in the script and save the chnages
3. Go to the connection.py and replace ".functions" with ".new_function_script" at line 6 and save the changes

That's it! You are ready to go :)
